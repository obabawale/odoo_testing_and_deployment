# odoo_testing_and_deployment
## Project to showcase testing and deployment in Odoo

### Description
Non-tested code is a recipe for disaster. Odoo codebase is a very complex one which makes it prone to additional layer of complexity by adding untested code. This implementation is to set up an Odoo project for unit testing using Odoo's built-in TransactionCase, SingleTransactionCase, and HTTPCase classes. CircleCI is used for automating the testing and deployment of the updates to the code.
